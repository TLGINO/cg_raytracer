## Problems

**Ray not generating from origin** :
when testing the ray not generating from origin, we tried with setting origin(4, 0, 0).
By doing so the image shown the spheres going to the left.
Since we were going to the right this was the expected behavior, but during sessions 
people among the class were discussing that should be the opposite. 
At the end the TA told us the behavior was correct.

All problems have been solved.
